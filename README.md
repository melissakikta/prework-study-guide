# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to create this webpage as a way to begin my path towards becoming a developer. This projected was created as a way to practice basic coding skills, learn simple techniques for creating the styles that I wanted, and ensure that I was using the proper software. I was trying to trouble shoot any issues that would come about with my current hardware and software and practice some basic computing skills. 

Through this process, I was able to gain helpful insights into the process of developing a website and creating a GitHub profile. This allowed me to work through some missteps in my coding process and debug my pathway to find success.
